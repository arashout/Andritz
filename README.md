##ChangeLines
For some reason on my work computer I can't pass command line arguements into my vbs scripts. 
My alternative solution is to insert lines/variables to the vbs script each time I want to run an
autohotkey script. This is a proof of concept. 
##Paste73CharsPerLine.ahk
SAP GUI has an alternative word editor that is much faster and simpler than the "word" like one that is the default.
When opening entries with "Long Text" it is orders of magnitude faster to use this alternative. The downside is that
you are only allowed to enter 73 characters per line.
I created this small autohotkey script to make copy and pasting strings longer than 73 characters into SAP painless and
fast.
