# Andritz
This is the top level directory of things I have developed at Andritz
##AHK
Autohotkey scripts - ranging from simple utilities to an ATTEMPT at automating pulling drawings from Matrix (A GUI hosted on internet explorer)
##ReadInspection
Sometimes we were required to transfer measurements from inspection reports written in word into Excel for the PM for easy viewing. I created a WORD parser to look for measurements and save them to csv, which saved around 30 minutes each time we had to do this
##VBA
Where I keep all the VBA modules I developed at Andritz.
Most of them automate processes that users used to do manually, usually very repetitive that users avoided them if they could. 
One in particular was so well recieved that people in Pell City, Alaboma are currently using it as well
