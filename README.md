##Paste73CharsPerLine.ahk
SAP GUI has an alternative word editor that is much faster and simpler than the "word" like one that is the default.
When opening entries with "Long Text" it is orders of magnitude faster to use this alternative. The downside is that
you are only allowed to enter 73 characters per line.
I created this small autohotkey script to make copy and pasting strings longer than 73 characters into SAP painless and
fast.
##SAPquickLookup
If you need to look-up a material number, this script saves you a couple of clicks.
Later on I will expand it out to other operations
It basically uses a autohotkey in conjuction with VBS script to achieve this (Passing a parameter materialNum through the command line)
