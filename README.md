# Andritz
This is the top level directory of things I have developed at Andritz
## AHK
Autohotkey scripts - ranging from simple utilities to an ATTEMPT at automating pulling drawings from Matrix (A GUI hosted on internet explorer)
## ReadInspection
Sometimes we were required to transfer measurements from inspection reports written in word into Excel for the PM for easy viewing. I created a WORD parser to look for measurements and save them to csv, which saved around 30 minutes each time we had to do this
## VBA
Where I stored all the VBA modules I developed at Andritz. Most of them are part of an automation suite that uses SAP GUI API to quickly perform tasks from the comfort of Microsoft Excel. This suite was very well recieved at Andritz and all the project/product managers at the Delta Service Centre use it.
